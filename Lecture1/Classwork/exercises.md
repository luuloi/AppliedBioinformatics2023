# Student score analysis.
You have a file named "scores.txt" that contains student names and their corresponding grades, one record per line, separated by a comma. 

- Task 1: Your task is to write an AWK script to read this file, calculate the average grade for each student, and print the results.
- Task 2: Your task is to write an AWK script to read this file, identify students who scored above a given threshold (e.g., 80), calculate the average score for these high-scoring students, and print the results.

# Sales data analysis.
You have a file named "sales_data.txt" that contains sales data for different products. Each line in the file represents a sale and contains three fields: product name, category, and sale amount, separated by a comma. 
Your task is to write an AWK script to read this file, calculate the total sales for each product category, find the category with the highest sales, and print the results.

# Fasta analysis.
You have a FASTA file named "sequences.fasta" that contains DNA sequences in the following format:

>>Sequence1
>
>ATCGATCGATCGATCG
>>Sequence2
>
>AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT
>
>>Sequence3
>
>ATGATGATGATG

Your task is to write an AWK script to read this FASTA file, analyze the sequences, calculate the length of each sequence, find the sequence with the highest length, and calculate the average length of all sequences.
